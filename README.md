# Questions-Answering-system-for-Covid-19
Beacuse this is my very first attempt into **Question Answering System**, this notebook is not the original rather i have only edited some parts and added few codes. The original notebook can be found <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi/a-qa-model-to-answer-them-all'>here</a>  
There are many ways and frameworks for building QA system, i have used **DistilBert** for this task here. see <a href='https://programmerbackpack.com/bert-nlp-using-distilbert-to-build-a-question-answering-system/'>this</a> article for detail explanations or any articles in your convienent for this topic.  
Also i have used earlier versionn of transformer library as latest version didnot worked for me(i could not figure out the way around).
