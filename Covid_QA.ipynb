The importance of viral foodborne diseases is increasingly being recognized, and several international organizations have found that there is an upward trend in their incidence. Thus, in this review, state-of-the-art information regarding virus persistence in food and the environment is compiled.',\n",
              " 'Pathogenic microorganisms usually originate from an infected host or directly from the environment; however, only a small proportion of these microbes cause infection. This chapter discusses the pathogens that are transmitted through the environment such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Many human pathogens can be transmitted only by direct or close contact with an infected person or animal such as herpesvirus. Virus transmission by the airborne route may be both direct and indirect inhalation of infectious droplets or through contact with contaminated fomites. Water-borne diseases—such as yellow fever, dengue, filariasis, malaria, onchocerciasis, and sleeping sicknessare transmitted by insects that breed in water or live near water. The common bacterial pathogens transmitted through water include Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Vibrio, Helicobacter, and Legionella. Opportunistic pathogens are also numerous in the environment, and the most important opportunistic pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis and water-borne outbreaks may be caused by norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Coxsackie virus, echovirus, and adenoviruses.

A review of 48 independent studies revealed that severe GI dysfunction is only evident in a small number of COVID-19 cases, with 11 ± 2% exhibiting diarrhea and 12 ± 3% exhibiting vomiting and nausea. In addition to these cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in feces from some asymptomatic, mildly- and pre-symptomatic individuals. Fecal shedding of the virus peaks in the symptomatic period and can persist for several weeks, but with declining abundances in the post-symptomatic phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is occasionally detected in urine, but reports in fecal samples are more frequent. The abundance of the virus genetic material in both urine (ca. 10(2)–10(5) gc/ml) and feces (ca. 10(2)–10(7) gc/ml) is much lower than in nasopharyngeal fluids (ca. 10(5)–10(11) gc/ml). There is strong evidence of multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 in the gut and infectious virus has occasionally been recovered from both urine and stool samples. The level and infectious capability of SARS-CoV-2 in vomit remain unknown. In comparison to enteric viruses transmitted via the fecal-oral route (e.g. norovirus, adenovirus), the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted via feces or urine appears much lower due to the lower relative amounts of virus present in feces/urine. The biggest risk of transmission will occur in clinical and care home settings where secondary handling of people and urine/fecal matter occurs. In addition, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA genetic material can be detected by in wastewater, this signal is greatly reduced by conventional treatment. Our analysis also suggests the likelihood of infection due to contact with sewage-contaminated water (e.g. swimming, surfing, angling) or food (e.g. salads, shellfish) is extremely low or negligible based on very low predicted abundances and limited environmental survival of SARS-CoV-2. These conclusions are corroborated by the fact that tens of million cases of COVID-19 have occurred globally, but exposure to feces or wastewater has never been implicated as a transmission vector.',\n",

This pathway occurs via diffusion and gravity-induced drift of single virions and respiratory droplets consisting primarily of water, including small fraction of nonvolatile matter, and containing virions. These processes are accompanied by water evaporation resulting in reduction of the droplet size. The manifold of information concerning these steps is presented in textbooks and articles not related to virology and the focus is there frequently on biologically irrelevant conditions and/or droplet sizes. In this brief review, we systematically describe the behavior of virions and virion-carrying droplets in air with emphasis on various regimes of diffusion, drift, and evaporation, and estimate the rates of all these steps under virologically relevant conditions. In addition, we discuss the kinetic aspects of the first steps of infection after attachment of virions or virion-carrying droplets to the epithelium, i.e., virion diffusion in the mucus and periciliary layers, penetration into the cells, and the early stage of replication. The presentation is oriented to virologists who are interested in the corresponding physics and to physicists who are interested in application of the physics to virology.',\n",

              " 'Viruses are often transmitted via food and the environment. Contamination may be controlled either by preventing its occurrence or by inactivating the contaminating virus. The majority of agents transmitted in this way are human enteric viruses, produced either in the intestines or the liver. They are shed in human feces (noroviruses also in vomitus) in a broad range of circumstances, and they are relatively stable outside the host. Non-enteric viruses are less often transmitted via foods and are generally less environmentally stable. Insofar as vaccines are available, they are able to prevent fecal shedding. Viruses shed in feces via the water-carriage toilet may be eliminated by proper treatment and disinfection of the wastewater. In the foods context, the most effective antiviral measures are cooking and hand washing. Detection methods are most useful after the fact, in investigating outbreaks and devising preventive measures.',\n",

Viral, environmental and host factors play roles in virus infection and disease. The virus has high transmissibility and is rapidly transmitted to people through close contact and droplets from coughing, sneezing and talking loudly, as well as through contact with contaminated objects. As crowding is an environmental risk factor for contamination, its transmission is high among patients and staff in hospital and also in elderly-care centers. It is more common in the elderly, in men, and subjects with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy.']"

This chapter discusses the pathogens that are transmitted through the environment such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Many human pathogens can be transmitted only by direct or close contact with an infected person or animal such as herpesvirus. Virus transmission by the airborne route may be both direct and indirect inhalation of infectious droplets or through contact with contaminated fomites. Water-borne diseases—such as yellow fever, dengue, filariasis, malaria, onchocerciasis, and sleeping sicknessare transmitted by insects that breed in water or live near water. The common bacterial pathogens transmitted through water include Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Vibrio, Helicobacter, and Legionella. Opportunistic pathogens are also numerous in the environment, and the most important opportunistic pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis and water-borne outbreaks may be caused by norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Coxsackie virus, echovirus, and adenoviruses. Respiratory diseases are also associated with a large number of viruses such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and adenovirus.

            "context:  Viruses are often transmitted via food and the environment. Contamination may be controlled either by preventing its occurrence or by inactivating the contaminating virus. The majority of agents transmitted in this way are human enteric viruses, produced either in the intestines or the liver. They are shed in human feces (noroviruses also in vomitus) in a broad range of circumstances, and they are relatively stable outside the host. Non-enteric viruses are less often transmitted via foods and are generally less environmentally stable. Insofar as vaccines are available, they are able to prevent fecal shedding. Viruses shed in feces via the water-carriage toilet may be eliminated by proper treatment and disinfection of the wastewater. In the foods context, the most effective antiviral measures are cooking and hand washing. Detection methods are most useful after the fact, in investigating outbreaks and devising preventive measures.\n",

            "context:  SARS-CoV-2 in bats was transmitted to humans at a live and wet animal market in China through the intermediate host, creating COVID-19. Viral, environmental and host factors play roles in virus infection and disease. The virus has high transmissibility and is rapidly transmitted to people through close contact and droplets from coughing, sneezing and talking loudly, as well as through contact with contaminated objects. As crowding is an environmental risk factor for contamination, its transmission is high among patients and staff in hospital and also in elderly-care centers. It is more common in the elderly, in men, and subjects with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy.\n",
